        <h2>YCC1112: Literature and Humanities 2</h2>
        <p>
            Common Curriculum • 5 MCs</p>
        
        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Literature and Humanities 2 engages creative works of art and literature in a world that is becoming increasingly complex and hard to grasp because of rapid and constant change. The works respond to the changing relationship between the secular and the sacred; the experience of cross-cultural encounters; the formation of national identities; the challenges of modern urban life; the creation of new social movements; and the realities and fantasies of colonialism, post-colonialism and globalisation.  

Works read might include:
•	Shakespeare’s The Tempest
•	Honoré de Balzac’s Père Goriot
•	Lu Xun’s Diary of a Madman and Other Stories
•	Virginia Woolf’s Dalloway
•	Eileen Chang’s Love in a Fallen City
•	Tayeb Salih’s Season of Migration to the North
•	Sonny Liew’s The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye</p>

            Common Curriculum • 5 MCs</p>
        
        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Philosophy and Political Thought 2 brings students into closer contact with Buddhist and Islamic ideas and with the intellectual makers of the modern world – the early proponents of modern science and technology, free trade and economic growth, and the modern state – and their critics. We consider how different conceptions of modernity and enlightenment shed light on one another and puzzle over the relationship between thinking and doing.

            Common Curriculum • 5 MCs</p>
        
        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Scientific Inquiry 2 aims to develop a deeper appreciation of scientific thinking by tackling a question that is still under debate. This year, as last, the focus is on climate change and, specifically, how we know that the global climate is changing. We study this question not only because it is vitally important for humanity, but also because to answer it scientists must draw on evidence from many different fields. The topic also provides a clear example of how science can inform social practices and government policies.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course will introduce students to the practice of creative nonfiction writing. It will explore the genre&#39;s manifold forms, including memoir, personal essay, literary journalism, lyric essay, and op-eds. Each week, students will read classic and contemporary examples of creative nonfiction and practise the craft themselves through guided writing exercises. The reading list will include many diaspora, emigrant, and third-culture writers alongside progenitors of the genre, such as Michel de Montaigne and Li Shang-Yin. Students will craft two main essays over the course of the semester, as well as a variety of shorter original pieces.</p>

It will involve close and systematic readings of a selection of their main texts, which are widely regarded as some of the most influential works to emerge from France. It will also seek to locate the distinctive approach of both Derrida and Deleuze respectively with respect to the way that their work has been taken up and used more broadly, and to address disputes about the meaning and adequacy of their views.</p>

Contemporary political philosophy offers rich materials to answer these questions; we will read authors such as Rawls, Nozick, Cohen, Sen, and Anderson. The course satisfies the following dimensions of the Philosophy major: Skills, problems; Historical, new.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course focuses on twentieth-century narratives that explore sexuality and gender issues in their socio-historical contexts. It examines adolescent attachments, sororal and brotherly love, friendship, etc., and how these relations tip over to homosociality and eroticism. As an introductory course, it familiarises students with debates on sexual identities and politics through analyses of fictional works from the US, UK, and Asia, offering a vocabulary for queer experience and perspectives that illuminate queer interiority and same-sex relations. Overall, the course reflects on and challenges fictions and critical approaches that are essentially &#34;queer.&#34;</p>

Few people are aware, however, that half a million African slaves were also transported to various locations in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea during the same period. This course explores the trafficking in and employment of slaves in a comparative and global context from ancient Rome until today. We will examine the role slavery (in its various forms) has played in the development of empires spanning the Atlantic and Indian Oceans over many centuries.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course will explore the rich world of medieval romance through the strange and often beguiling encounters with the supernatural that pervade these texts. Considering shape-shifters, marvellous objects, and experiences of the miraculous or uncanny, we will investigate how romances fashion exotic, escapist worlds that at the same time reflect contemporary values and anxieties. We will ponder what magic reveals about human motivations, especially in situations of moral ambiguity. We will pay special attention to the historical and intellectual contexts in which medieval magic was understood, and to its intersections with other spheres of knowledge such as science and theology.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">What does it mean to speak about literature of the Islamic world? Can the Islamic be a salient category for the literary? With these broad questions in mind, this class will introduce students to the diverse literary traditions of the Islamic world from the post-classical (1350-1850) to the modern period (1850-current day). Considering literary traditions such as Malay, Persian, and Urdu, we will interrogate the transformative role Arabic literary culture has played in regions where Islam is the dominant religion. Then, in the modern period, we will ask how colonialism and the nationalisms that followed changed these literary landscapes.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Creative Nonfiction encompasses several artistic and exploratory practices. Students learn how to create nonfiction in authentic, innovative, and unexpected ways.  With readings, discussions, and in-class exercises, students practice shaping their ideas into inventive projects.  In this iteration of the course, students become familiar with diverse approaches to nonfiction, with special attention to literary journalism, personal narratives, and the audio essay—an emerging form that uses sound as argument.  Students practice being critical readers, generate their own ideas, and use literary texts to comment on contemporary issues. This course welcomes newcomers as well as those with a background in the genre.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In the 1880s, the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche proclaimed the death of God and called for a new life‐affirming philosophy to combat the rise of nihilism. Nietzsche, one of the most provocative thinkers of the nineteenth century, lived in an age of cultural tumult and intellectual transformation. This course provides a window into this period through a close engagement with Nietzsche’s writings, including his philosophical works, his personal correspondence, and his autobiography. Attention will also be paid to his friendship and subsequent disillusionment with the composer Richard Wagner.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Woolf lived in an era of tremendous historical-mindedness in which artists, writers, and historians were deeply engaged with how the past should be represented. Students will explore Woolf’s engagement in this debate through close analysis of her diaries, drafts, and published works as well as primary source materials (museum artifacts and contemporary newspapers) that help place her engagement in the social, cultural, and political issues of the early twentieth century. Was this engagement with the past at odds with a liberal belief in progress, or was the past, for Woolf, a causal entity to be interpreted for its historical difference?</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Against the backdrop of the Cold War, the Bandung Conference of 1955 stands as a symbolic event in the history of decolonisation of Asia and Africa. We examine ‘Bandung’ as a nodal point from which a variety of postwar narratives emerged, including freedom and independence, non-alignment, Third World internationalism, connecting even the US civil rights movement with Bandung. A diverse range of materials will be explored, including popular writing, film, photographs, newsreels, newspapers, journals, official documents, as well as a field trip to the conference museum in Bandung to consider the role of public history.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Why is democracy valuable? What does it even mean to call a political order a democracy? How can democracy represent a &#39;will of the people&#39; if the people disagree with one other? Does democracy conflict other important values and goals? In this course we answer these questions by first establishing a conceptual framework from the history of political thought, and then plunging into contemporary democratic theory. We will use theory to analyse contemporary local and international examples, and be open to real examples posing challenges to theory. 
The course satisfies these dimensions of the Philosophy major: Skills, Problems; Historical, New.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course focuses on the history of the Japanese empire from 1868 to 1945. Whilst consolidating the knowledge of the Japanese empire, this course aims to develop critical thinking on existing historiography, by thinking about limitations of traditional historiography, whilst exploring new approaches emerging in the field. Why do debates on empire sit uncomfortably with the literature on nationalism? What are imperial and trans-imperial agents and practices? We examine themes such as migration, citizenship, religion, development, settler communities, trade, experts, and outlaws. What was the role of ‘culture’ as a constructed ideology to connect diverse local contexts?</p>

This course interrogates Sinophone Studies as a critical, interdisciplinary alternative to previous constructions of Chinese literature and culture tied to the nation-state and progressive narratives of modernity. Students will study fiction and films from Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, the United States, and the PRC, along with critical works explaining the ways that diaspora, colonialism, comparative empires, and ethnic or minority studies have informed the rise of Sinophone Studies.

Nyāya, a tradition within Brahminical Indian philosophy presented and defended sophisticated methods of reasoning and norms for debate that are still being studied today. In this course, we focus on sections of the Nyāya-sūtra in translation and its early commentaries, along with some Buddhist and Mīmāṃsā texts. Not only will we consider methods and norms, but we will look at how Indian thinkers put them into practice in arguments on topics such as the existence of God.</p>

It was the first – and until London in 1811 – the only Western city to reach a population of a million. Rome reflected the grandeur and diversity of its empire. It was a cosmopolitan, multi-lingual, and multi-ethnic mega-city, which show-cased Roman might, organizational efficiency, and wealth through public works, monumental architecture, and a consumer culture that large swaths of the population could indulge in. The course will deal with the management of a pre-industrial metropolis and its political, cultural, social and economic life.</p>

This course will focus on the pragmatics of pejoratives, the philosophical study of disparaging speech. We will focus especially on disparaging racial and gendered speech, known as &#34;slurs&#34; or, broadly &#34;hate speech.&#34;</p>

Students will explore issues related to political philosophy, the theoretical underpinnings of international law and justice, with the goal of ultimately coming to appreciate meaningfully how these ideas shape their own lives.</p>

Actors rehearse and perform scenes from classical traditions of Greece, India, and China. The selected scripts invite comparative analysis of themes and dramaturgical elements. Rehearsal is required outside course meetings. Exercises and projects train the actor’s instrument, expand one’s understanding of theatre, and foster personal growth.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Writing Hybrid is an intermediate writing module that explores the tradition and practice of writing in between and across the genres. Building upon the skills from the introductory writing courses, it explores the ways in which hybrid texts expose the tensions and limits of conventional genres (poetry, fiction, nonfiction) and propose alternative forms of writing practices. It investigates, in particular, the ways hybrid writing (lyric essays, prose poems, text +image, etc) are able to embody postcolonial identities, queer/ minority / liminal subjectivities, which resist traditional forms and genres. Students will undergo seminars, writing workshops leading toward a final creative portfolio.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Food and ecology are inextricably linked through the production of domesticated food through agriculture and livestock and in the harvesting of wild plants and animals.  The production and consumption of food has downstream consequences through energy consumption, food waste, trophic interactions and transportation of food worldwide.  These topics link to many of the fundamental concepts of ecology, including population biology, the niche, trophic interactions, nitrogen cycling and the effects on biodiversity.  This module explores each of these topics intensely through lectures, guest lectures, readings and interactive field trips to local systems.</p>

In this course you will consider the extent to which urbanisation has changed natural ecosystems and led to the rise of a new urban ecology, and consider how humans can value and manage this in a socio-ecological context. We will then address how the confluence of climate change, globalisation and urbanisation are fundamentally altering our living space and the implications for human health and wellness.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sharks are keystone species, unfortunately global demand for shark products fuel a &gt;US$1 billion industry that has caused dramatic declines in shark populations. A major obstacle preventing successful regulation of the shark fin trade and shark conservation is the mislabelling and/or misidentification of dried products or carcasses that have had fins removed. We will use DNA barcoding techniques to identify the sharks traded in Singapore. Previous molecular experience is not required. With the data generated we will produce a scientific paper for publication.</p>

Many operating systems and microcontrollers are at least partly coded in C. C is lightweight, fast and offers a complex memory management system. This apparent simplicity does not mean that it is simple to learn and master though, as it requires deep understanding of how memory works and how data is represented. In this course, we will cover the C language along with memory management and segmentation. C can be useful for Capstones in applied mathematics and natural sciences.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Computer vision is Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on images and video as the input. Images and videos are everywhere and contain rich visual information. However, how can we extract that information? The goal of computer vision is to do this task. In other words, it attempts to make computers work like human eyes: to understand and recognize the world through images or videos. Human visual perception, after millions of years of evolution, is extremely good in understanding and recognizing objects or scenes. To have similar abilities, algorithms based on various cues and techniques (including machine learning) have been developed, and this course is about some of those algorithms.

Computer vision is the most important application of deep learning. Compared to other types of data, images and video are more complex in terms of extracting the underlying information. Recently, it has been shown that deep learning is effective in addressing the problem. Thus, in this course, we will also learn deep learning, particularly in the context of solving computer vision problems.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Microeconomics analyses individual decision making and its implications for economic outcomes. Here the term “individual” is used broadly to include individuals, households and firms. We deconstruct the demand-supply model by analyzing consumers&#39; choices as outcomes of rational preference maximization and producers&#39; decisions as results of profit maximization in various market structures. We study how equilibrium of demand and supply in competitive markets generates efficient outcomes. We then analyze a variety of instances when markets fail to be efficient. This course will place special emphasis upon mathematical foundations of theoretical models. In particular, we will study and apply techniques in multivariate calculus, and unconstrained and constrained optimization.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Economics is concerned with the study of how individuals make decisions and how these decisions affect, and in turn are affected by, the distribution of limited resources in society. This course introduces students to the formal analysis of the economy as a whole. The goal is to understand how decisions by the firms, consumers and institutions affect the markets, and the welfare implications of such choices for society. Special attention is placed on the effect of government and monetary policies on the economy. Emphasis is placed upon the mathematical foundations of theoretical models.</p>

It will introduce students to the dynamic relationship between gender and work across time and space, investigating why only certain types of work are considered “real work” in certain parts of the world, women’s growing entry into the formal sector, the feminization of certain types of labour, the stigmatized nature of domestic work, women’s labour movements, and the role played by women’s work in international development. Readings will be drawn from sociology, anthropology, labour studies, geography, and economics.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This module introduces the anthropology of marriage and kinship, asking questions like: How does the creation of kin through marriage vary cross-culturally? How and why do states exercise control over marriage? Why are people marrying later and having fewer babies, and how will this development shape societies in the twenty-first century? Who has access to marriage, who does not, and why? Is marriage a tool of patriarchal domination? Or can it become a site for culturally and historically specific forms of agency? Students will conduct original research and read ethnographies of places around the world with a focus on Asia.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Representation is a hallmark of democratic systems, yet certain groups, like women, are systematically underrepresented in politics.  This class examines the variation of women’s representation in legislatures around the world, the theories to explain it and ask whether and how it matters for politics and policy outcomes. We explore the ways that notions of gender shape policy choices and are embedded in institutions and practices. Finally, we will look beyond established political processes to consider broader phenomena such as the role of women in social movements or gender inequality in development and globalisation.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The field of behavioral economics draws on insights from other disciplines, especially psychology, to enrich our understanding of economic behaviour and decision making generally. Individuals frequently make decisions that systematically depart from the predictions of standard economic models. In this course we will attempt to understand these departures by integrating the psychology of human behavior into economic analysis. This course analyzes all types of decisions made by agents on a daily basis (from which breakfast to have to where to send the kids for education, etc.). Special focus will be put on decision making in a context of bounded rationality.</p>

How did China get to this point? Where is it going? This class explores China’s political and economic development beginning from the early Republican era, charts the Chinese Revolution, then turns to the Maoist and Reform eras in which it explores China’s transition from a closed and impoverished agriculture society to regional and world power.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course examines the determinants and mechanisms through which poor countries develop. While this course focuses primarily on the development of political structures that enhance human development, it also gives significant attention to social and economic change associated with modernization. This course is essentially an exploration of the political economy of development in the developing world. Among others, the questions we explore in this class include: Why are some countries poor, repressive, and violent? Why have some developed economically, achieved stability, and protected human rights, while others stagnate and/or decline? What determines state capacity, good governance, and development?</p>

The course will examine three different theoretical frameworks that have recently been used to understand the place of emotions in politics: 1) neuroscientific; 2) neo-Aristotelian; and 3) Freudian/psychoanalytic. It will focus on the different conceptions put forth by each of these frameworks and the different constellations of emotions that are analysed and/or advocated by these theories. Questions to be addressed include: Are there “negative” emotions? What criteria do we use to decide whether an emotion ought to be excluded from democratic practices?</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Financial markets are subject to periodic bouts of “irrational exuberance” that lead to bubbles in asset prices, frequently followed by a crash. These afflict particularly stock and foreign exchange markets and the banking industry. Despite repeated attempts to regulate finance, crises recur with remarkable frequency and regularity. In “This Time is Different”, Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart document eight centuries of financial folly. These crises have profound effects on the real economy, leaving a legacy of unemployment and slow growth. We use economic analysis to study several financial, foreign exchange, and banking crises in their historical and social contexts.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This class studies the economics of cities and urban problems by understanding the effects of geographic location on the decisions of individuals and firms. Traditional microeconomic models are typically spaceless, yet location and distance plays an increasingly important part in modern economics. We will study questions such as Why do cities exist? How do firms decide where to locate? Why do people live in cities? We will analyze the economic problems that arise as people and firms cluster in cities. We will also discuss specific urban economic problems such as firm location, crime, transportation, housing, education, and local government economics.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course offers a window into the complex arrangements of social life in cities. It explores the ways in which social structures and dynamics are folded into and through urban contexts, specifically by imagining the city from four planes of social life. We examine (i) ‘cities of difference’ (ii) ‘cities of scales’ (iii) ‘cities of relations’ (iv) ‘cities of actions’. At the end of the course, students will gain clearer recognition of the darker structures in urban life, the complicity of society and culture in stabilising them, but also a deeper appreciation for spaces of hope that allow for change.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course examines the labor of natural history through the life of Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913). It focuses less on the evolutionary insights of Wallace and more on the historical and material conditions of his work. In this way, it investigates the nexus of science, empire, and infrastructure and how this nexus shaped the contours and collections of natural history work in Southeast Asia. The course seeks to answer: What is “natural” about natural history? How does natural history work? And why is there a statue of Wallace in front of the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum?</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course examines the comparative political economy of capitalist societies, broadly defined as the relationship between the market and the state, and the ways in which the triangular relationship between the state, labor and business differs from one capitalist country to another. The course will survey cases from North America, Western Europe and East Asia, as well as a number of important themes such as poverty and welfare, racial and gender disparities, neoliberalism, financialization and globalization. There will be heavy emphasis upon the transformation in the political-economic landscape facing capitalist societies in the period since the end of the 1970s.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">What has been the course, causes, and consequences of economic globalisation? This module has as its focus the long-run evolution of the global economy, particularly events from 1800. This roughly 200 year period is instructive in that it witnesses the integration of the world’s nations into the first truly global economy, its disintegration in the wake of WWI, the post-WWII reintegration of the global economy, and its potential reversal into the present day. The course will examine variation in institutions, policy, and technology to understand this evolution and its effects on development, inequality, and international relations.</p>

Yet, despite its ubiquity, populism is a slippery phenomenon and can be difficult to define. In this course, we will examine populism from the perspectives of philosophy, politics, and economics. Among other things, we will examine definitions of what populism is and its relationship to liberal democracy; we will examine the causes of populism, such as free trade and economic inequality; we will examine the goals of various populist movements from around the world; and we will debate the legitimacy of policy responses to populism.</p>

We will then examine Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s critique of liberal state of nature theories in his Discourse on the Origin of Inequality.  After that we turn to twentieth-century critiques of liberalism offered by Virginia Woolf, Malcolm X, and Michel Foucault. Here we will study how liberalism relies on masculine (Woolf), racist (Malcolm X) or disciplinary (Foucault) mechanisms and examine the political alternatives offered by these thinkers.</p>

We will study different social contexts, from the Middle East to Southeast Asia and the Western world, to investigate how ordinary Muslims grapple with their religious commitments and other demands of everyday life. We will analyze how the interplay between the religious and non-religious dimensions of Muslim life unfold in fields as diverse as art and aesthetic production, finance and banking, organ transplantation, law and politics, resource extraction and environmental protection, and expressions of gender and sexual identities.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The desire to systemically control the city using information is as old as the history of urban planning. This seminar examines Smart Cities through a retrospection into the history and theory of urban data and computational models in urban planning. Learning from the technocratic planners (1910s-1920s), the cybernetic vision and urban renewal (1960s), the development of GIS (1960s), critical GIS (1990s), Big data and civic technologies (2010s), the course critically examines contemporary Smart Cities that include but are not limited to Masdar, Songdo, Sidewalk Lab Toronto, and Singapore’s Smart Nation initiatives.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course provides an introduction to the study of oil and its effects on politics, culture and the environment. With an emphasis on issues of urbanization, we will delve into a variety of national contexts to explore different interpretations on those effects: from the “paradox of plenty” and the “resource curse,” to critical analyses of the “magical” qualities of oil states, the “mythmaking” abilities of oil companies, and the “enduring legacy” of the oil industry. We will read studies ranging range across multiple scales, from examinations of “space, oil and capital” to investigations of the “lifeworlds of oil and gas.”</p>

This course will look at some seminal conceptions of freedom in contemporary political theory, as well as feminist, socialist and other challenges to these (more or less liberal) conceptions. The goal is not to arrive at a definitive theory of freedom, if such a thing exists, but to examine our own ideas about what constitutes freedom or unfreedom, and to consider the applicability of these conceptions to political institutions and problems today.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The 20th and 21st centuries have seen an unprecedented global expansion in the number of one-party regimes. Despite not conforming to standard definitions of democracy, these regimes have proven more stable and developed faster than non-democracies with which they are often grouped. In this module, students will gain a deeper understanding of politics within such regimes from a comparative politics perspective. Topics covered include the conditions facilitating the establishment and spread of one-party regimes, how leaders manage threats originating from both inside and outside the regime, the role of elections, and the conditions in which transitions away from regimes occur.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course covers econometric techniques as applied in empirical work in economics, at a level that is accessible to advance undergraduates. The topics are divided into two categories: Market Valuations and Non-Market Valuations. We begin with demand and supply estimation and the computation of consumer and producer surpluses. We investigate the use of surplus measurements to evaluate the impact of policies and the introduction of new good. We then move towards estimating the ‘demand side’ of environmental economics. The focus will be on stated and revealed preferences techniques for estimating the non-market values associated with environmental and other public goods.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course explores anthropological perspectives on how human rights discourses are produced and used in the world today. While the modern idea of human rights was only formalized in the aftermath of the Second World War, since that time, human rights discourses have spread around the world and been adopted transnationally by widely varying actors. Starting from the premise that the transnational discourse of rights must be understood in local contexts, we will explore the meaning and use of human rights from different perspectives.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course examines the various aspects of parental influence on children’s development, with a focus on cultural differences in parenting styles and practices. Topics to be covered include a critical evaluation of the conceptual and functional differences of parenting practices across cultures, and how these may influence children’s development in diverse contexts. The notion of “good enough parenting” and parenting as a bidirectional process will be analysed. The course concludes with a discussion of whether parents are the most important source of influence, considering the many other domains of influence in children’s lives, such as peers.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Although founded on ideals of humanism and human exceptionalism, anthropology provides a unique perspective on the nature of anthropocentrism in the Anthropocene. This course builds on key theoretical insights articulated by a range of post-humanist scholars in order to rethink the relationships between us as a species of cultured animal and a range of other species. In doing so, this course will trouble the distinction between ethnological methods, ethnographic representation, ethology, and biology to provide insight on how contemporary scholarship in the discipline provides new ways of understanding ecology, environmental activism, scientific research, medical technology and non-human animal rights.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This module examines the multiple ways in which cities are built across national boundaries. Processes of urbanization have been long shaped by global flows of capital, people, and knowledge. These transnational currents raise important questions for how we understand urban development, past and present. This advanced seminar will give students the chance to carefully review a range of perspectives on the phenomenon of global and transnational urbanism. Topics will range from the effects of maritime trade and colonial expansion on the production of space, the rise of global logistics, the emergence of the idea of  “world cities,” and recent trends in itinerant urban expertise.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course introduces students to psychological anthropology. We probe the cultural assumptions underpinning theories of the mind and consider how anthropology contributes to scholarship on the psyche and its workings. We begin by examining the relationships between the psyche, the body, and power through engaging with conversations in cross-cultural psychology, psychoanalysis, black existentialism, and feminist and queer theory. Next, we ground our analysis in ethnographies by anthropologists who are also practicing psychiatrists, therapists, and social workers. Addressing such topics as madness, addiction, and possession, we examine the interrelationships between power, politics, and intimate experience.</p>

We explore how resistance is conceptualized; the many faces of power; the power of law in coercion and repression, and the responses to power, including but not limited to resistance; how resistance emerges; various types of resistance, including individual, collective, uncoordinated, coordinated, hidden, and open forms; the role of law in tactics of resistance; the role of lawyers; and the efficacy of law in achieving social change. We explore these issues by reading classic and recent works, as well as discussing case studies selected and presented by students.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course explores the dynamic role of non-state actors and how they interact with more established major players in global affairs (states and intergovernmental organizations). It focuses on civil society organizations and the business sector as two major categories of non-state actors. Core questions include: When and how do non-state actors matter? What are the sources of their influence? What kind of strategies do they use to achieve their goals? What are normative implications of the growing influence of these new actors? And how should the study of IR respond to this relatively new phenomenon?</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course provides an overview of contemporary research and theories in the field of human social neuroendocrinology—a field that lies at the intersection of social psychology and behavioral endocrinology. Students will learn about the reciprocal relationship between hormones and social behavior: how hormones modulate human social behavior (e.g., aggression, prejudice, mating behaviors, decision-making), and the role of the social environment in altering hormone systems and hormone-behavior relationships. The module will also delve into methodological practices and considerations for designing social endocrine studies.</p>

        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This course will cover experimental lab and field research from social psychology that address social injustice and related topics, such as achievement gaps, racism, sexism, ageism, health disparities, and deficits in equity, diversity, and inclusiveness. Students will read scientific articles, chapters, and scholarly reviews regarding this area of research and the seminar will largely revolve around discussions of those papers and their weekly written reactions. The course will culminate in a paper assignment that will require students to identify a pressing social injustice and to develop an implementable program to address it based on research we cover in the class.</p>
